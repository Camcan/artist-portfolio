      opener: "I am a diligent, passionate Media Studies scholar pursuing an academic career at the intersection of digital humanities, media, and affect studies. In 2016 I completed an MA in Creative writing with Distinction from the International Institute of Modern Letters, and have had poems and prose accepted for various online and print journals. Alongside my academic and literary work, I have maintained a practice in visual arts as a painter, sculptor, and dancer. I have exhibited artwork regularly in Wellington during my studies here, curating group exhibitions as well as producing my own creative bodies of work.",
